# TechHealthDB
TechHealthDb is a fully‑designed SQL Server database project that demonstrates my ability to build, optimize, and document real‑world relational database systems. The project simulates a health‑tracking platform where customers use wearable devices, purchase products, interact with coaches, and generate monthly health metrics.
